> We formalize the string-matching problem as follows. We assume that the
text is an array T Œ1 : : n of length n and that the pattern is an array P Œ1 : : m
of length m  n. We further assume that the elements of P and T are char-
acters drawn from a finite alphabet †. For example, we may have † D f0,1g
or † D fa; b; : : : ; zg. The character arrays P and T are often called strings of
characters.
