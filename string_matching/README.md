> We formalize the string-matching problem as follows. We assume that the
text is an array T[1..n] of length n and that the pattern is an array P[1..m]
of length m <= n. We further assume that the elements of P and T are char-
acters drawn from a finite alphabet Σ. For example, we may have Σ = {0,1}
or Σ = {a,b,...,z}. The character arrays P and T are often called strings of
characters.
